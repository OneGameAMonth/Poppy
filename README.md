*Poppy*

A game about a dog, his nerd dog-nappers, beautiful landscape and nasty blood stains.

_Sightseeing is not a crime._


## Gameplay

You play a cute little doggy named Banyo. _Poppy!_ You are with two
maniacs, Tina and Chris who has killed your father Ian.
In order to uncover Chris and get back on him, you need to grab his
diary where he's written down all his crimes.

Bring it to a helpful person, maybe a copper or a German tourist, before Chris or Tina catch you or they kill someone.


## Controls

Use the classic WASD or the arrow keys to move around.

Hit the spacebar for various actions like barking.

Pressing F2 will make a screenshot which will stored in whatever
application cache files directory is default on your operating system.
